      I focus on growing heirloom tomatoes — unique, flavorful varieties passed down through generations. These tomatoes are known for their rich taste, diverse colors, and history. Each plant has a story, and I love keeping those stories alive.

      I believe in growing with care — using compost, rainwater, and natural pest control whenever possible. It's all about working with nature, not against it, to keep the garden (and planet) healthy.
